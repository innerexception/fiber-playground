Each map polygon has the Core Node and potentially the following static entities:
    -Resource nodes
    -Refineries
    -Production centers
    -Logistics centers

Reducing the Core Node to zero, then capturing it, will flip ownership of the polygon

Players can build automated static defenses or drones.

Any drone can be manned.
